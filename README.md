# Cipher Hunter

## Project Spec

### Theme

Cipher Hunter is a puzzle game style message board web application where users can create and share secret codes or 
encrypted messages for others to solve. Users can write coded messages with hints, post them for others to see,
and attempt to solve messages posted by others. I want also try and focus on the user experience and experiment
with cool looking styles and interactive elements. 

For this project, I decided not to use any framework or anything like that, but stick to plain vanilla html,css, and javascript
to be able to further cement my understanding of the topics and subjects we have learnt about over this semester and not waste any time
having to learn a new framework that would take away from this project. 

The data that my project will manage will be users, user information, and puzzles created by users that can be loaded dynamically into the site. I want to leverage the database that we created and used in the last few assignments to be able to store users, puzzles, and scores that I can store and users can access.

The home page will dynamically update based on the number of puzzles that have been created and stored in the database. Moreover, the leaderboard functionality follows the
same way as I will display a list of all users dynamiclly and add them to the leaderboard with their information from the data base. 

### Main Features:
Users will be able to: 
- View a feed of puzzles created by other users
- Submit new secret messages with an answer key and optional hints
- Attempt to solve messages submitted by others
- Filter through secret messages based off their author, solved status, etc
- View leaderboard and other stats
- Provide short tutorials on basic cryptogrophy concepts

### Optional features
These features depend on if there is enough time to implement them
- User accounts
- Diffculty levels
- Multiple Cipher types
- Dark Mode
- Notifications
- Chat/Comments 

### Target Audience
- Puzzle lovers
- Students learning about cryptography
- People who enjoy logic-based games and wordplay 

## Project Wireframe

Instead of using moqups.com, I am more familiar with Figma, an interactive and collaborative UI design tool. 
Attached below is the initial mockup of the landing page of my website and a few other pages for now.

NOTE: This is not what the final product will look like but is a rough idea of where the buttons will go and the basic layout

<br>

This is the create page where the user is able to create a secret code word for users to solve! There will be 
many different filters and options for users to be able to customize their puzzle and change the difficulty

This is a sample leaderboard where users will be able to see the performace of others and compare themselves to the top puzzle solvers

And lastly, this is an image of the entire thing with the connections between the buttons and the pages.
